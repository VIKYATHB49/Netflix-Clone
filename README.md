# 🎬 Netflix Clone – Frontend Project

This is a **frontend-only Netflix Clone** built to replicate the core UI and visual experience of Netflix. It was created to demonstrate my frontend development skills, with a strong focus on clean design, responsiveness, and interactivity.

🚀 **Note:** Best viewed on **tablets and desktops** for the full visual experience including video autoplay, smooth layout transitions, and carousel effects.
